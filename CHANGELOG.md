## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Agent Skill Creation Loop** — Closed-loop skill system where agents autonomously create, consume, and improve structured playbooks scoped to each product. Based on the Karpathy AutoResearch pattern.
  - **Skill Extraction** — When a task completes, an LLM analyzes the task's activities and deliverables to extract 0-3 reusable procedures. Skills are stored as structured steps with commands, prerequisites, and verification methods.
  - **Skill Matching & Dispatch Injection** — During dispatch, matched skills are injected as primary instructions (before knowledge/footnotes). Matching uses keyword overlap, role filtering, and title similarity — not regex.
  - **Skill Reporting** — Agents report whether they used a skill and whether it succeeded. Reports update a Bayesian confidence score (prior weight of 2 prevents cold-start inflation).
  - **Inline Promotion/Deprecation** — Draft skills auto-promote to active after 2 successes with confidence >= 0.6. Skills with 3+ uses and confidence < 0.3 auto-deprecate.
  - **Skill Versioning** — New skill versions link to their predecessor via `supersedes_skill_id`. Matching deduplicates superseded skills.
- **Skills API** — `GET/POST /api/products/[id]/skills`, `GET/PATCH /api/products/[id]/skills/[skillId]`, `POST /api/products/[id]/skills/[skillId]/report`
- **Migration 028** — `product_skills` and `skill_reports` tables with indexes

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Schema syntax error on fresh DB init** — Missing `);` between `user_task_reads` and `product_program_variants` table definitions caused `near "CREATE": syntax error` on startup. Artifact from PR #89 merge resolution.
- **Pending migrations 023-027 not applied** — Migration 022 ID collision (old `error_reports` vs new `health_scores`) prevented new migrations from running. Fixed migration records and applied missing ALTER TABLE columns (`similarity_flag`, `auto_suppressed`, `variant_id`, `batch_review_threshold`, `health_weight_config`).

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Idea Similarity Detection & Deduplication** — New ideas are compared against existing ideas using text similarity. Ideas >90% similar to previously rejected ideas are auto-suppressed. Remaining similar ideas get a warning badge. Suppression audit trail stored in `idea_suppressions` table. ([PR #88](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/88))
- **Operator Chat Overhaul** — Floating chat widget accessible from any page. Threaded conversations per task with `@agent` mentions, command palette (`/status`, `/nudge`, `/checkpoint`), and unread message badges. Chat inbox shows all active conversations. ([PR #89](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/89))
- **Swipe Undo & Batch Review** — 10-second undo window after any swipe action (full rollback including task deletion for approved ideas). Batch review mode for reviewing multiple ideas in a table view with bulk actions. Configurable batch threshold per product. ([PR #90](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/90))
- **Product Program A/B Testing** — Create variants of the product program and run concurrent or alternating A/B tests. Research and ideation run against each variant independently. Statistical comparison of approval rates per variant. Promote winning variant or cancel test. ([PR #91](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/91))
- **Automated Rollback Pipeline** — GitHub webhook listens for merged PRs, CI failures, and status events. Post-merge health monitoring with configurable check intervals. Auto-creates revert PRs via GitHub API when failures detected. Rollback history with acknowledgment flow. ([PR #92](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/92))
- **Activity Dashboard Workspace Picker** — `/activity` page lists all workspaces with active/total task counts instead of hardcoding to the first workspace. ([PR #95](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/95))

### Fixed
- **Knowledge entries FK on task delete** — `knowledge_entries.task_id` now nullified when a task is deleted, preventing dangling foreign key references. ([PR #93](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/93))
- **HMAC timing attack in GitHub webhook** — Signature verification now uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` instead of string equality comparison.
- **Swipe undo rebuilds preferences & health** — Undoing a swipe now triggers preference model rebuild and health score recalculation, keeping both in sync.

---

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Health Check Endpoints** — `GET /api/health` (unauthenticated summary, authenticated full detail) and `GET /api/health/metrics` (Prometheus text exposition). Checks DB integrity, gateway connectivity, agent status, task queue depth, research cycle freshness, and cost cap utilization. ([PR #87](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/87))
- **Database Backup API** — On-demand backup creation, listing, and restoration via `/api/admin/backups`. Optional S3 upload support. Backup management UI in Settings page. ([PR #86](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/86))

### Fixed
- **Build error from backup PR** — `@aws-sdk/client-s3` added as dependency and webpack external so dynamic imports resolve at build time.
- **Research health query** — `MAX(id)` on UUID columns replaced with `MAX(started_at)` to correctly identify the latest research cycle per product.
- **Repo hygiene** — Removed committed `.mc-workspace.json` and `db-backups/` binaries. Added `db-backups/`, `.tmp/`, `.mc-workspace.json` to `.gitignore`.
- **Redundant DB writable check** — Removed separate `SELECT 1` test in health check; writable status derived from integrity check result.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Preference Learning (Karpathy AutoResearch Pattern)** — Swipe history is now analyzed after every swipe to build a per-product preference model. The model captures category approval rates, complexity preferences, impact score thresholds, tag patterns, and examples of approved/rejected ideas. The resulting `learned_preferences_md` is injected into both research and ideation prompts, steering future cycles toward what the user actually wants.
- **Preference Backfill API** — `POST /api/products/backfill-preferences` rebuilds preference models for all products with existing swipe history. Used to bootstrap models from historical data.

### Fixed
- **Token counts always showing 0** — Research and ideation cycles now pass token usage (`promptTokens`, `completionTokens`, `totalTokens`) and model name through to `emitAutopilotActivity()` and `recordCostEvent()`. Previously the usage data was extracted from the gateway but discarded before storage. Added debug logging (`[LLM] Response usage:`) to verify gateway returns usage data.

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Ideation CHECK constraint failure** — LLM occasionally returns idea categories not in the schema's allowed list (e.g. `"analytics"`, `"design"`). Categories are now validated against the allowed set before insert, falling back to `"feature"` for unrecognized values.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Toast Notification System** — Global toast notifications surface errors, warnings, and status updates in real-time. Error toasts persist until dismissed and include a "Report this issue" action.
- **Error Reporting via Email** — Users can report issues directly from error toasts or inline error messages. Clicking "Report this issue" opens the default email client pre-filled with error details and recent system logs (autopilot activity, failed cycles, task activities). Reports go to hello@autensa.com.
- **Pending Ideas Badge** — Product cards on the Autopilot listing page (`/autopilot`) now show a red notification badge with the count of pending ideas awaiting review, similar to iPhone app icon badges.
- **SSE Error Surfacing** — Autopilot errors and cost cap warnings broadcast via Server-Sent Events now appear as toast notifications in real-time, even if the user is on a different tab.
- **`useErrorReport` Hook** — Reusable hook for triggering error toasts with one-click email reporting from any component.

### Fixed
- **Autopilot Pipeline Stops on Navigation** — The research-to-ideation pipeline was orchestrated entirely client-side. Navigating away from the product page killed the polling loop and ideation was never triggered. Pipeline orchestration now runs server-side: research auto-chains into ideation on completion. The UI is a status viewer, not the orchestrator. Multiple products can run pipelines concurrently.
- **LLM Retry on Timeout/Network Errors** — The `complete()` function in `llm.ts` now retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s) on `AbortError` and network failures (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`, `fetch failed`). Non-retryable errors (4xx, parse errors) fail immediately. This fixes the "Roofs in a Box" ideation failures caused by OpenClaw WebSocket instability.

### Improved
- **Fire-and-Forget Run Now** — The "Run Now" button sends a single POST request and returns immediately. The server handles the full research → ideation pipeline. The UI polls for status every 5s to update the button state, but navigation no longer interrupts the pipeline.

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Session Key Prefix UI** — Contributed by [@balaji-g42](https://github.com/balaji-g42). Agents now have a configurable `session_key_prefix` field in the Agent Modal, allowing custom OpenClaw session routing per agent. Dynamically created agents inherit the prefix from the workspace's master agent. Planning sessions resolve the prefix with a priority chain: custom request prefix > assigned agent > master agent > default (`agent:main:`). ([PR #85](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/85))

### Fixed
- **Session Key Prefix Sanitization** — Empty or whitespace-only prefix values are stored as `null` so fallback defaults work correctly. Missing trailing colons are auto-appended to prevent malformed session keys (e.g., `agent:mainplanning:` instead of `agent:main:planning:`).

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Product Settings Modal** — Gear icon (⚙️) in the product dashboard header opens an inline settings modal. Edit product name, description, repository URL, live URL, default branch, build mode, and icon without leaving the dashboard. Saves via the existing PATCH `/api/products/[id]` endpoint.
- **Import README.md in New Product Wizard** — "Import from README" button on the Product Program step (step 2). Fetches the repository's README via GitHub API (public repos) or falls back to the local filesystem (`~/projects/<repo-name>/README.md` for private repos). Pre-populates the product program textarea. New API route: `POST /api/products/import-readme`.
- **Auto-Generate Product Description** — "Auto-generate" button on the New Product basics step. Sends the repo URL and live URL to a new API endpoint that fetches README + website content, sends it to the LLM via OpenClaw Gateway's `/v1/chat/completions`, and returns a concise 1-2 sentence description. New API route: `POST /api/products/generate-description`.
- **Improved Private Repo Warning** — Repo validation warning now explicitly tells users the repo may be private: *"Could not verify this repository — it may be private or may not exist. Private repos work fine, the agent will use local access."*

### Fixed
- **Dispatch Hang on Stage Transitions** — All server-side dispatch fetch calls now have a 30-second `AbortSignal.timeout`. Previously, if the OpenClaw gateway was slow or unresponsive during testing/review/verification transitions, the PATCH request would hang indefinitely — potentially crashing the server. The timeout applies to all 10 dispatch call sites across the codebase. ([#84](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/issues/84))
- **Stale OpenClaw Connection After Timeout** — Added `forceReconnect()` to the OpenClaw WebSocket client. When a dispatch fails (timeout or connection error), the client now tears down the stale WebSocket and clears all pending requests, so the next dispatch attempt gets a fresh connection instead of reusing a dead one.
- **Stale Markdown in Agent Modal** — The Agent Modal now fetches fresh `soul_md`, `user_md`, and `agents_md` from the API each time it opens, instead of displaying cached data from the Zustand store that was loaded once at page load. ([#75](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/issues/75))

### Improved
- **Pre-Migration Database Backups** — Contributed by [@cgluttrell](https://github.com/cgluttrell). Before running any pending migrations, a timestamped backup is created using SQLite's `VACUUM INTO` (safe for WAL-mode databases). Keeps the last 5 backups. If backup fails, migrations abort entirely. ([PR #79](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/79))
- **Migration 013 Data Guard** — Contributed by [@cgluttrell](https://github.com/cgluttrell). The destructive "fresh start" migration now checks for existing tasks and locally-configured agents before running. Databases with real data are preserved instead of silently wiped on upgrade. ([PR #79](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/79))
- **Static Device Identity Path** — Contributed by [@org4lap](https://github.com/org4lap). Removed dynamic `filePath` parameter from `loadOrCreateDeviceIdentity()`, binding file operations to the module-level constant. Resolves TP1004 static analysis warning. ([PR #82](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/82))

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### 🚀 Product Autopilot — The World's First Autonomous Product Engine

Autensa v2 transforms from a task orchestration dashboard into the world's first autonomous product improvement engine. Point it at any product and it runs a continuous research → ideation → build loop.

### Added

#### Product Autopilot Pipeline
- **Autonomous Research Engine** — AI agents analyze your codebase, scan your live site, and research your market automatically. Discovers competitors, user intent, conversion patterns, SEO gaps, and technical opportunities. Configurable schedules (daily, weekly, custom cron, or on-demand). Research results stored with full source attribution.
- **AI-Powered Ideation** — Research feeds into ideation agents that generate concrete, scored feature ideas. Each idea includes impact score (1–10), feasibility score (1–10), size estimate (S/M/L/XL), technical approach, and a direct link to the research that inspired it.
- **Swipe Interface (IdeaSwipe)** — Tinder-style card interface for reviewing ideas. Four actions: Pass (rejected, preference model learns), Maybe (saved to pool, resurfaces in 1 week), Yes (task created, build agent starts), Now! (urgent dispatch, priority queue). Full swipe history tracking.
- **Product Program** — Inspired by Karpathy's [AutoResearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) `program.md` pattern. Each product has a living document that instructs research and ideation agents on what to look for, priorities, and constraints. Evolves as swipe data accumulates.
- **Preference Learning** — Per-product preference model trained from swipe history. Category weights, complexity preferences, and tag patterns adjust automatically. Ideas get sharper with every iteration.
- **Maybe Pool** — Ideas swiped "Maybe" enter a holding pool. Auto-resurface after configurable period with fresh market context. Batch re-evaluation mode. Promote to Yes at any time.
- **Product Scheduling** — Configure research and ideation cycles per product. Cron-style schedules with enable/disable toggles. Auto-dispatch rules for approved ideas.
- **Product Management UI** — Full product CRUD with URL scanning, research report viewer, ideation cycle history, swipe statistics, and per-product cost tracking.

#### Convoy Mode — Parallel Multi-Agent Execution
- **Convoy orchestration** — Large features decomposed into subtasks with dependency-aware scheduling. 3–5 agents work simultaneously on one feature.
- **Dependency graph visualization** — Visual DAG showing subtask dependencies, completion status, and agent assignments.
- **Inter-agent mailbox** — Convoy agents can send messages to each other during execution. Messages queued and delivered at checkpoints.
- **Convoy progress tracking** — Real-time progress aggregation across all subtasks. Parent task status derived from subtask completion.

#### Agent Health Monitoring
- **Stall detection** — Agents are monitored at configurable intervals (default 6 min). Stall threshold (5 min no activity), stuck threshold (15 min), and auto-nudge after 3 consecutive stall events.
- **Auto-nudge** — Stalled agents are automatically killed and restarted from their last checkpoint. If nudge fails, task is flagged for manual intervention.
- **Health indicators** — Real-time health badges on agent cards (healthy/stalled/stuck/offline).
- **Health API** — Per-agent and aggregate health endpoints for monitoring.

#### Operator Chat
- **Queued notes** — Add context to running tasks. Notes are delivered to the agent at its next checkpoint.
- **Direct messages** — Real-time delivery to the agent's active session. Agent incorporates changes immediately.
- **Chat history** — Full per-task chat log preserved. Every message, note, and agent response.
- **Chat listener** — Server-side relay that bridges operator messages to agent sessions via OpenClaw.

#### Cost Tracking & Budget Caps
- **Per-task cost events** — Every API call tracked with model, tokens, and cost.
- **Per-product cost aggregation** — See total spend across all tasks for a product.
- **Daily and monthly budget caps** — Set limits that auto-pause dispatch when exceeded.
- **Cost breakdown API** — Detailed reports by agent, model, task, product, and time period.
- **Cost dashboard UI** — Visual breakdown with charts and spending trends.

#### Checkpoint & Crash Recovery
- **Checkpoint save** — Agent progress saved at configurable intervals. Includes task state, files modified, and agent context.
- **Checkpoint restore** — Resume from any saved checkpoint. Manual restore via API or automatic on crash.
- **Checkpoint history** — View all checkpoints per task with timestamps and metadata.

#### Knowledge Base
- **Learner agent** — Captures lessons from every build cycle: what worked, what failed, patterns observed.
- **Knowledge injection** — Learner entries are injected into future dispatch messages so agents don't repeat mistakes.
- **Per-workspace knowledge** — Knowledge scoped to workspace for relevance.

#### Workspace Isolation
- **Git worktrees** — Repo-backed projects get isolated branches via git worktree. No conflicts between concurrent agents.
- **Task sandboxes** — Local/no-repo projects get dedicated directories under `.workspaces/task-{id}/`.
- **Port allocation** — Dev server ports from 4200–4299 range with unique constraint. No port conflicts between concurrent builds.
- **Serialized merge queue** — Completed tasks merge one at a time with conflict detection. Product-scoped locking for concurrent completions.
- **Workspace status UI** — ISOLATED badge on kanban cards, WorkspaceTab in task modal showing workspace path, branch, port, and merge status.

#### Automation Tiers
- **Supervised** — PRs created automatically, you review and merge manually. Default for production apps.
- **Semi-Auto** — PRs auto-merge when CI passes and review agent approves. For staging and trusted repos.
- **Full Auto** — Everything automated end-to-end. Idea to deployed feature. For side projects and MVPs.
- **Per-product configuration** — Change automation level anytime per product.

- 18 new database tables
- 80+ new API endpoints
- 2,831 lines of new core library code (autopilot + convoy + health + checkpoints + workspace + mailbox + chat + learner)
- 8 new UI components for autopilot features
- Shared LLM completion helper (`lib/autopilot/llm.ts`) for stateless HTTP calls to AI providers

---

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Agent Status Stale After Stage Handoff** — When a task moved between pipeline stages (builder → tester → reviewer → done), the previous agent's status remained `working` in the database permanently. Now the workflow engine resets the outgoing agent to `standby` on every stage handoff (unless the agent has other active tasks). The task PATCH endpoint also resets the assigned agent when a task moves to `done`.

---

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Dispatch Deadlock Bug** — Fixed race condition where a failed dispatch left the task stuck in `in_progress` permanently. The planning poll idempotency check now detects stale dispatches (no agent activity within 2 minutes) and retries instead of silently skipping. Previously, if the OpenClaw WebSocket dropped during dispatch, the task would never recover.
- **Dispatch Error Recovery** — The dispatch endpoint now resets the task to `assigned` with a recorded error when delivery to the agent fails, instead of returning a generic 500 and leaving the task in a broken state. This allows the UI and poll loop to detect and retry the dispatch.

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Canonical Gateway Agent Sync** — OpenClaw-installed agents are now treated as the canonical catalog and synced into Mission Control automatically (startup/scheduled + dispatch-triggered).
- **Dynamic Task Routing (Hybrid)** — Task dispatch now supports dynamic per-task routing using planner candidates plus role/fallback safeguards.
- **Governance Tests** — Added unit tests for evidence gating, done-state validation blocking, fixer auto-provisioning, and stage failure counting.

### Changed
- **Team Role Assignment UX** — Task role names are now normalized and non-freeform in Team assignment flow to prevent duplicate role keys (e.g., `Learner` vs `learner`).
- **Board Override Path** — Added explicit board-only override support (disabled by default) with audit logging hooks.

### Fixed
- **Done-State Consistency** — Prevented tasks from ending in `done` when validation/failure state indicates unresolved issues.
- **Stage Evidence Gates** — Enforced deliverable + activity requirements for stage progression; fail-back now requires a failure reason.
- **Failure Escalation** — Added escalation after repeated same-stage failures with guaranteed fixer provisioning when missing.
- **Working/Standby Agent Badges** — Agent status tags are now reconciled from active task state and update live with task updates (no manual refresh required after initial reload).
- **Duplicate Learner Role Rows** — Fixed duplicate learner role assignment caused by case mismatch.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Task Image Attachments** — Upload reference images (UI mockups, screenshots, etc.) to tasks. Images are included in agent dispatch context so AI agents can see what they're building. New Images tab in Task Modal with grid view, upload, and delete. (fixes #60)

### Fixed
- **PORT env var** — Dev and start scripts now respect `PORT` env var instead of hardcoding 4000. Config fallback URL also uses `process.env.PORT`. (fixes #68)
- **Webhook auth bypass** — Webhook routes (`/api/webhooks/*`) now bypass `MC_API_TOKEN` middleware, relying on their own HMAC signature validation. Fixes broken callbacks in split-service deployments. (fixes #64)
- **Agent "Working" status** — Agents now correctly reset to standby when they have no remaining active tasks. Previously the Working tag persisted after task completion/deletion. (fixes #61)

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Kanban UX Improvements** — Improved horizontal scrollbar visibility and hit area. Added optional compact empty columns mode (off by default, toggleable via Settings → Kanban UX). (PR #66)
- **Docker CI Workflow** — GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the Dockerfile on push. (PR #69)
- **Pipeline Documentation** — Added `docs/HOW-THE-PIPELINE-WORKS.md` explaining the full multi-agent pipeline lifecycle, stages, loop-back mechanics, and Learner knowledge injection.

### Fixed
- **Workspace Deletion** — Fixed `SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY` error when deleting workspaces that have auto-created workflow templates or knowledge entries. Cascade deletion now properly cleans up dependent records. (PR #71, fixes #70)

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Multi-Agent Workflow Pipeline** — Full task lifecycle now supports staged orchestration: `planning → inbox → assigned → in_progress → testing → review → verification → done`.
- **Core Agent Bootstrap** — New workspaces can auto-bootstrap a 4-agent core team: Builder (🛠️), Tester (🧪), Reviewer (🔍), and Learner (📚).
- **Workflow Engine Coordination** — Added queue-aware review draining (`drainQueue()`), automatic role-based stage handoffs, and fail-loopback routing.
- **Learner Knowledge Loop** — Learner notifications on stage transitions plus knowledge injection into future dispatch messages.
- **New API Routes**
  - `POST /api/tasks/[id]/fail`
  - `GET /api/tasks/[id]/roles`
  - `POST /api/workspaces/[id]/knowledge`
  - `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/workflows`

### Changed
- **Strict template defaults** — Strict workflow is now default, with review as queue stage and verification owned by the `reviewer` role.
- **Workspace initialization** — New workspaces can clone workflow templates and bootstrap core agents automatically.
- **Project branding/docs** — Updated project branding to Autensa (formerly Mission Control) and added explicit privacy-first statement in docs.

### Fixed
- **Role mismatch** — Fixed strict template verification role (`verifier` → `reviewer`).
- **Review queue bypass** — Fixed auto-advance behavior that could skip proper review queue flow.
- **Dispatch status transition** — Fixed dispatch route using hardcoded `done`; now uses computed next workflow status.
- **Assigned-status resolution** — Fixed mapping so `assigned` resolves to builder stage dispatch correctly.
- **Task template assignment** — Fixed task creation path so default workflow template is attached automatically.
- **Learner role assignment** — Fixed missing `task_roles` learner assignment so the learner receives transition events.

### Migration
- **Migration 013: Fresh Start** — Resets runtime task/agent/event data, sets Strict as default workflow template, and bootstraps core agents for the default workspace.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Agent Activity Dashboard** — Dedicated page for monitoring agent work with mobile card layout. (#48 — thanks @pkgaiassistant-droid!)
- **Remote Model Discovery** — Discover AI models from OpenClaw Gateway via `MODEL_DISCOVERY=true` env var. (#43 — thanks @davetha!)
- **Proxy Troubleshooting** — Added docs for users behind HTTP proxies experiencing 502 errors on agent callbacks.

### Fixed
- **Force-Dynamic API Routes** — All API routes now use `force-dynamic` to prevent stale cached responses. (#43)
- **Null Agent Assignment** — `assigned_agent_id` can now be null in task creation schema. (#38 — thanks @JamesCao2048!)
- **Dispatch Spec Forwarding** — Planning spec and agent instructions now forwarded in dispatch messages. (#51)
- **Dispatch Failure Recovery** — Tasks stuck in `pending_dispatch` auto-reset to planning status. (#52)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Gateway Agent Discovery** — Import existing agents from your OpenClaw Gateway into Mission Control. New "Import from Gateway" button in the agent sidebar opens a discovery modal that lists all Gateway agents, shows which are already imported, and lets you bulk-import with one click. Imported agents display a `GW` badge for provenance tracking. ([#22](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/issues/22) — thanks [@markphelps](https://github.com/markphelps)!)
- **Docker Support** — Production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml with persistent volumes, and `.dockerignore`. Runs as non-root, uses `dumb-init` for signal handling, includes health checks. ([#21](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/21) — thanks [@muneale](https://github.com/muneale)!)
- **Agent Protocol Conventions** — Added `PROGRESS_UPDATE` and `BLOCKED` message formats to the Agent Protocol docs to prevent agent stalling. ([#24](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/24) — thanks [@nice-and-precise](https://github.com/nice-and-precise)!)

### Fixed

- **Planning Flow Improvements** — Refactored polling to prevent stale state issues, fixed "Other" free-text option (case mismatch bug), made `due_date` nullable, increased planning timeout to 90s for larger models, auto-start polling on page load. ([#26](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/pull/26) — thanks [@JamesTsetsekas](https://github.com/JamesTsetsekas)!)
- **WebSocket RPC Deduplication Bug** — The event deduplication cache was silently dropping repeated RPC responses with the same payload hash, causing request timeouts. RPC responses now bypass dedup entirely.
- **Next.js Response Caching** — Dynamic API routes that query live state (e.g., agent discovery) now use `force-dynamic` to prevent stale cached responses.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### 🔒 Security

- **API Authentication Middleware** — Bearer token authentication for all API routes. Set `MC_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local` to enable. Same-origin browser requests are automatically allowed.
- **Webhook HMAC-SHA256 Validation** — Agent completion webhooks now require a valid `X-Webhook-Signature` header. Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` to enable.
- **Path Traversal Protection** — File download endpoint now uses `realpathSync` to resolve symlinks and validate all paths are within the allowed directory.
- **Error Message Sanitization** — API error responses no longer leak internal details (stack traces, file paths) in production.
- **Security Headers** — Added `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers via Next.js config.
- **Input Validation (Zod)** — Request payloads for tasks, agents, and workspaces are validated with Zod schemas before processing.
- **Repository Audit** — Purged sensitive files from git history, updated `.gitignore` to block database files and backups.

### Added

- **Ed25519 Device Identity** — Gateway pairing now uses Ed25519 key-based device identity for secure handshakes.
- **ARIA Hook** — Real-time agent tracking bridge between ARIA and Mission Control (`scripts/aria-mc-hook.sh`).
- **Planning Poll Endpoint** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/poll` for long-poll planning updates.
- **Retry Dispatch** — New `POST /api/tasks/[id]/planning/retry-dispatch` to retry failed task dispatches.
- **Auto-Dispatch Module** — `src/lib/auto-dispatch.ts` for automatic task assignment after planning.
- **Planning Utilities** — `src/lib/planning-utils.ts` with shared planning logic.
- **MC Bridge Scripts** — Python and shell bridge scripts for external integrations.

### Changed

- **Node.js v25 Support** — Updated `better-sqlite3` to v12.6.2 for Node v25 compatibility.
- **Default Port** — Mission Control now defaults to port 4000 (previously 3000).
- **Improved Planning Tab** — Enhanced UI with better question rendering, progress tracking, and error handling.
- **Agent Sidebar Improvements** — Better status display, model selection, and agent management.
- **Activity Log Overhaul** — Cleaner timeline UI with better type icons and formatting.
- **Live Feed Improvements** — Better real-time event display with filtering options.

### Fixed

- **Same-origin browser requests** — Auth middleware no longer blocks the UI's own API calls.

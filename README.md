## 🚀 What's New in v2.3.1

### Bug Fix
- **Schema syntax error** — Fixed missing `);` in schema that caused startup errors on fresh databases. Applied pending migration columns for similarity detection, A/B testing, and batch review.

### v2.3.0 Highlights

### Idea Similarity Detection
- **Auto-deduplication** — New ideas are compared against existing ones. Ideas >90% similar to rejected ideas are auto-suppressed. Similar ideas get a warning badge. Full audit trail.

### Operator Chat Widget
- **Chat from anywhere** — Floating chat widget with threaded conversations per task. `@agent` mentions, command palette (`/status`, `/nudge`, `/checkpoint`), and unread badges.

### Swipe Undo & Batch Review
- **10-second undo** — Full rollback of any swipe including task deletion. Batch review mode for table-view multi-select actions.

### Product Program A/B Testing
- **Test your product program** — Run concurrent or alternating A/B tests on product program variants. Research and ideation run against each variant. Statistical comparison of approval rates.

### Automated Rollback Pipeline
- **Auto-revert failed deploys** — GitHub webhook monitors merged PRs. Post-merge health checks. Auto-creates revert PRs when failures detected.

### Activity Dashboard Picker
- **Workspace selector** — `/activity` lists all workspaces instead of hardcoding to one.

### v2.0 Highlights

Autensa v2 is a ground-up expansion from task orchestration dashboard to **the world's first autonomous product improvement engine**. It researches your market, generates feature ideas, lets you decide with a swipe, and builds them — automatically.

### 🔬 Product Autopilot — The Full Pipeline

The headline feature. Point Autensa at any product (repo + live URL) and it runs a continuous improvement loop:

1. **Autonomous Research** — AI agents analyze your codebase, scan your live site, and research your market: competitors, user intent, conversion patterns, SEO gaps, technical opportunities. Runs on configurable schedules — daily, weekly, or on-demand.

2. **AI-Powered Ideation** — Research feeds into ideation agents that generate concrete, scored feature ideas. Each idea includes an impact score, feasibility score, size estimate, technical approach, and a direct link to the research that inspired it.

3. **Swipe to Decide** — Ideas appear as cards in a Tinder-style interface. Four actions:
   - **Pass** — Rejected. The preference model learns from it.
   - **Maybe** — Saved to the Maybe Pool. Resurfaces in 1 week with fresh context.
   - **Yes** — Task created. Build agent starts coding.
   - **Now!** — Urgent dispatch. Priority queue, immediate execution.

4. **Automated Build → PR** — Approved ideas flow through the full agent pipeline: Build agent implements the feature → Test agent runs the suite → Review agent inspects the diff → Pull request created on GitHub with full context.

**Your only job is the swipe.** Everything else is automated.

### 📄 Product Program (Karpathy AutoResearch Pattern)

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [AutoResearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) architecture. Each product has a **Product Program** — a living document that instructs research and ideation agents on what to look for, what matters, and what to ignore. The program evolves as swipe data accumulates: the system learns your taste, not just patterns.

### 🚛 Convoy Mode — Parallel Multi-Agent Execution

Large features get decomposed into subtasks with a visual dependency graph (DAG). Multiple agents (3–5) work simultaneously with dependency-aware scheduling:

- **Parallel subtask execution** — Independent pieces run concurrently
- **Dependency graph visualization** — See what depends on what
- **Health monitoring** — Detects stalled, stuck, or zombie agents automatically
- **Auto-nudge** — Reassigns or restarts agents that go dark
- **Crash recovery** — Checkpoints save agent progress; work resumes from last checkpoint, not from scratch

### 💬 Operator Chat — Talk to Agents Mid-Build

Don't wait for a PR to give feedback. Two communication modes:

- **Queued Notes** — Add context ("use the existing auth middleware") that gets delivered at the agent's next checkpoint
- **Direct Messages** — Delivered immediately to the agent's active session for real-time course correction

Full chat history preserved per task — every message, note, and response.

### 💰 Cost Tracking & Budget Caps

Granular spend visibility across every dimension:

- **Per-task cost tracking** — See exactly what each feature costs to build
- **Per-product aggregation** — Total spend across all tasks for a product
- **Daily and monthly caps** — Set budget limits that auto-pause dispatch when exceeded
- **Cost breakdown API** — Detailed reports by agent, model, and time period

### 🧠 Knowledge Base & Learner Agent

A dedicated Learner agent captures lessons from every build cycle — what worked, what failed, what patterns emerged. Knowledge entries are injected into future dispatches so agents don't repeat mistakes.

### 📋 Enhanced Planning Phase

Before any build starts, agents run a structured planning phase:

- AI asks clarifying questions about requirements and constraints
- Generates a detailed spec from your answers
- Multi-agent planning specs with sub-agent definitions and execution steps
- Approval gate — you review the plan before any code is written

### 🔄 Checkpoint & Crash Recovery

Agent progress is saved at configurable checkpoints:

- If a session crashes, work resumes from the last checkpoint — not from scratch
- Checkpoint restore API for manual recovery
- Checkpoint history visible per task

### 🎯 Preference Learning

Every swipe trains a per-product preference model:

- Category weights (growth, SEO, UX, etc.) adjust based on approvals/rejections
- Complexity preferences calibrate over time
- Tag pattern recognition refines idea generation
- Ideas get sharper with every iteration

### 🔁 Maybe Pool

Ideas you're not sure about don't disappear:

- Swiped "Maybe" ideas enter a holding pool
- Automatically resurface after a configurable period with new market context
- Batch re-evaluation mode to review accumulated maybes
- Can be promoted to Yes at any time

### 📡 Live Activity Feed

Real-time SSE stream of everything happening across all products:

- Research progress, ideation cycles, swipe events
- Build progress, test results, review outcomes
- Agent health events, cost updates, PR creation
- Filterable by product, agent, and event type

### 🛡️ Automation Tiers

Choose your comfort level per product:

| Tier | Behavior | Best For |
|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| **Supervised** | PRs created automatically. You review and merge manually. | Production apps |
| **Semi-Auto** | PRs auto-merge when CI passes and review agent approves. | Staging & trusted repos |
| **Full Auto** | Everything automated end-to-end. Idea → deployed feature. | Side projects & MVPs |

### 🔀 Workspace Isolation

Each build task gets an isolated workspace:

- **Git Worktrees** for repo-backed projects — isolated branch, no conflicts with other agents
- **Task Sandboxes** for local/no-repo projects — dedicated directory under `.workspaces/task-{id}/`
- **Port allocation** (4200–4299 range) for dev servers — no port conflicts between concurrent builds
- **Serialized merge queue** — completed tasks merge one at a time with conflict detection
- **Product-scoped locking** — concurrent completions for the same product queue automatically

### 📊 Product Scheduling

Configure autonomous cycles per product:

- Research frequency (daily, weekly, custom cron)
- Ideation frequency (after each research cycle, or independent schedule)
- Auto-dispatch rules (immediate on "Yes" swipe, or batch)
- Schedule management UI with enable/disable per schedule

## 🛡️ Privacy

Autensa is open-source and self-hosted. The project does **not** include ad trackers, third-party analytics beacons, or a centralized data collector.

Your task data, research results, ideas, swipe history, and product programs stay in your own deployment (SQLite + workspace). If you connect external services (AI providers or remote gateways), only the data you explicitly send to those services leaves your environment.

**Autensa** = The dashboard + autopilot engine (this project)
**OpenClaw Gateway** = The AI runtime that executes tasks ([separate project](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw))

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **OpenClaw Gateway** — `npm install -g openclaw`
- **AI API Key** — Anthropic (recommended), OpenAI, Google, or others via OpenRouter

### Install

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control.git
cd mission-control

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

> **Where to find the token:** Check `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `gateway.token`

### Run

```bash
# Start OpenClaw (separate terminal)
openclaw gateway start

# Start Autensa
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:4000** — you're in! 🎉

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npx next start -p 4000
```

---

## 🐳 Docker

You can run Autensa in a container using the included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose plugin)
- OpenClaw Gateway running locally or remotely

### 1. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file for Compose:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set at least:

```env
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://host.docker.internal:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Notes:
- Use `host.docker.internal` when OpenClaw runs on your host machine.
- If OpenClaw is on another machine, set its reachable `ws://` or `wss://` URL instead.

### 2. Build and start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**.

### 3. Useful commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f mission-control

# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (deletes SQLite/workspace data)
docker compose down -v
```

### Data persistence

Compose uses named volumes:
- `mission-control-data` for SQLite (`/app/data`)
- `mission-control-workspace` for workspace files (`/app/workspace`)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Autopilot Pipeline

```
RESEARCH → IDEATION → SWIPE → PLAN → BUILD → TEST → REVIEW → PR
   AI          AI      You      AI     Agent   Agent   Agent   Auto
```

1. **Research** — AI analyzes your product's market: competitors, SEO, user intent, technical gaps
2. **Ideation** — Research feeds ideation agents that generate scored feature ideas
3. **Swipe** — You review ideas as cards. Pass / Maybe / Yes / Now!
4. **Plan** — AI asks clarifying questions, generates a detailed spec
5. **Build** — Agent clones repo, creates branch, implements the feature
6. **Test** — Agent runs the test suite. Failures bounce back for auto-fix
7. **Review** — Agent inspects the diff for quality, security, best practices
8. **PR** — Pull request created on GitHub with full context and research backing

### Task Flow (Manual Tasks)

```
PLANNING → INBOX → ASSIGNED → IN PROGRESS → TESTING → REVIEW → DONE
```

Drag tasks between columns or let the system auto-advance them.

### Convoy Mode (Large Features)

```
                    ┌─ Subtask A (Agent 1) ──┐
PARENT TASK ────────┤                        ├──── MERGE & PR
                    ├─ Subtask B (Agent 2) ──┤
                    └─ Subtask C (Agent 3) ──┘
                         (depends on A)
```

Subtasks run in parallel with dependency-aware scheduling. Health monitoring detects stalls. Crash recovery via checkpoints.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|:---------|:--------:|:--------|:------------|
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` | ✅ | `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` | WebSocket URL to OpenClaw Gateway |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | Authentication token for OpenClaw |
| `MC_API_TOKEN` | — | — | API auth token (enables auth middleware) |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | — | HMAC secret for webhook validation |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | — | `./mission-control.db` | SQLite database location |
| `WORKSPACE_BASE_PATH` | — | `~/Documents/Shared` | Base directory for workspace files |
| `PROJECTS_PATH` | — | `~/Documents/Shared/projects` | Directory for project folders |

### Security (Production)

Generate secure tokens:

```bash
# API authentication token
openssl rand -hex 32

# Webhook signature secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
MC_API_TOKEN=your-64-char-hex-token
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-64-char-hex-token
```

When `MC_API_TOKEN` is set:
- External API calls require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Browser UI works automatically (same-origin requests are allowed)
- SSE streams accept token as query param

See [PRODUCTION_SETUP.md](PRODUCTION_SETUP.md) for the full production guide.

---

## 🌐 Multi-Machine Setup

Run Autensa on one machine and OpenClaw on another:

```env
# Point to the remote machine
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-shared-token
```

### With Tailscale (Recommended)

```env
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=wss://your-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-shared-token
```

---

## 🗄 Database

SQLite database auto-created at `./mission-control.db`. Migrations run automatically on startup (21 migrations). As of v2.0.1, a timestamped backup is created before any pending migration runs.

```bash
# Reset (start fresh)
rm mission-control.db

# Inspect
sqlite3 mission-control.db ".tables"
```

Key tables added in v2: `products`, `research_cycles`, `ideas`, `swipe_history`, `preference_models`, `maybe_pool`, `product_feedback`, `cost_events`, `cost_caps`, `product_schedules`, `operations_log`, `convoys`, `convoy_subtasks`, `agent_health`, `work_checkpoints`, `agent_mailbox`, `workspace_ports`, `workspace_merges`.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to OpenClaw Gateway

1. Check OpenClaw is running: `openclaw gateway status`
2. Verify URL and token in `.env.local`
3. Check firewall isn't blocking port 18789

### Planning questions not loading

1. Check OpenClaw logs: `openclaw gateway logs`
2. Verify your AI API key is valid
3. Refresh and click the task again

### Port 4000 already in use

```bash
lsof -i :4000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Agent callbacks failing behind a proxy (502 errors)

If you're behind an HTTP proxy (corporate VPN, Hiddify, etc.), agent callbacks to `localhost` may fail because the proxy intercepts local requests.

**Fix:** Set `NO_PROXY` so localhost bypasses the proxy:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Windows (cmd)
set NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Docker
docker run -e NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1 ...
```

See [Issue #30](https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control/issues/30) for details.

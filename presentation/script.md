## Slide 1 — Title

This is Autensa v2 — the autonomous product engine.

It watches your products, researches your market, generates feature ideas, and builds them — automatically — while you sleep.

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem

Here's the problem every builder faces.

Improving your product is a full-time job. You have to research competitors, brainstorm features, prioritize them, build them, test them, review the code, deploy it — and then do it all again. Most teams simply can't keep up.

Seventy-two percent of feature ideas never get built. The average time from idea to shipped feature is three to six months. And every feature sitting in your backlog is generating zero revenue.

---

## Slide 3 — Before vs After

Before Autensa, you were doing all of this manually. Researching competitors every week. Brainstorming in docs that get forgotten. Prioritizing in spreadsheets. Writing specs from scratch. Assigning work to developers and waiting. Reviewing pull requests by hand. Deploying and hoping for the best.

With Autensa v2, AI researches your market automatically. It generates ranked, scored feature ideas. You swipe Yes or No in seconds. Specs get written from the research. Build agents implement the feature immediately. Review agents verify quality and run tests. And a pull request shows up on GitHub — ready to merge.

---

## Slide 4 — The Full Pipeline

Here's the full pipeline: Research, Ideation, Swipe, Build, Test, Review, Pull Request.

Seven steps, end to end, from idea to shipped code. And only one of those steps is manual — the swipe. That's where you decide what gets built. Everything else runs on autopilot.

---

## Slide 5 — Research

Step one: autonomous research.

You point Autensa at your product. It reads your codebase, scans your live site, and researches your market. Competitive analysis — what your competitors are doing, where they're strong, where they're weak. Market signals — conversion patterns, pricing opportunities, growth channels. Technical gaps — performance issues, UX improvements, architecture upgrades. And user intent — what people are actually searching for and trying to do.

This runs daily, on a schedule. No manual work required.

---

## Slide 6 — Ideation

Step two: AI-powered ideation.

The research feeds directly into ideation agents that generate concrete, actionable feature ideas. Every idea is scored for impact, feasibility, and effort. Every idea includes a technical approach and complexity estimate. And every idea links back to the specific research that inspired it. No guessing — everything is evidence-based.

---

## Slide 7 — Swipe

Step three — and this is your only manual step.

Ideas show up as cards. You see the title, a description, impact score, feasibility score, and size estimate. Then you swipe.

Pass — you reject it, and the system learns from that preference. Maybe — it gets saved and resurfaces in a week with new context. Yes — a task gets created and a build agent starts coding immediately. Now — urgent dispatch. The agent drops everything and starts building right away, priority queue.

That's it. That's your entire job in this pipeline. Swipe.

---

## Slide 8 — Build to PR

Steps four through seven happen automatically.

First, a build agent clones the repo, creates a feature branch, and implements the feature — with full context from the research and the idea spec.

Then a test agent runs the project's test suite. If tests fail, it bounces the code back to the build agent for an automatic fix.

Next, a review agent inspects the diff. Code quality, security, best practices, breaking changes — the same standards a senior engineer would enforce.

Finally, a pull request gets created on GitHub with full context: what was built, why it was built, the research backing, risks, and technical approach. From there, you choose — review and merge manually, or let it auto-merge.

---

## Slide 9 — Safety Tiers

You control how much automation you're comfortable with.

Supervised mode is the default for production apps. Pull requests get created automatically, but you review and merge them manually. Full control.

Semi-auto mode is for staging environments and trusted repos. PRs auto-merge when CI passes and the review agent approves. You monitor.

Full auto mode is completely hands-off. From idea to deployed feature, everything is automated. This is ideal for side projects and MVPs where speed matters more than manual review.

You can change the automation level anytime, per product.

---

## Slide 10 — Operator Chat

New in v2 — you can talk to your agents while they're building.

You don't have to wait for a pull request to give feedback. There are two ways to communicate.

Queued notes let you add context that gets delivered at the next checkpoint. Something like "use the existing auth middleware" — the agent picks it up when it checks in.

Direct messages are delivered immediately to the agent's active session. "Skip the email notifications for now" — and the agent adjusts in real-time.

Full chat history is preserved per task. Every message, every note, every response.

---

## Slide 11 — Convoy Mode

Also new in v2 — Convoy Mode for parallel execution.

Big features get broken into subtasks. Multiple agents work simultaneously with dependency-aware scheduling. Three to five agents can work on one feature at the same time.

There's a visual dependency graph so you can see what depends on what. Health monitoring detects stalled or stuck agents and auto-nudges or reassigns them. And crash recovery means if an agent dies, work resumes from the last checkpoint — not from scratch.

---

## Slide 12 — More v2 Features

Here's everything else we shipped in v2.

A knowledge base where a learner agent captures lessons from every build cycle. That knowledge feeds into future dispatches so agents don't repeat the same mistakes.

Cost tracking with per-task, per-product, daily, and monthly spend tracking. Set budget caps that automatically pause dispatch when they're exceeded.

A planning phase where agents ask clarifying questions and generate specs before they start building. No blind coding.

Crash recovery with checkpoints that save agent progress, so work can resume if a session dies.

A live activity feed — a real-time stream of everything happening: research phases, build progress, test results, PR creation.

And preference learning — every swipe trains the model. Category weights, complexity preferences, tag patterns. The ideas get sharper over time.

---

## Slide 13 — Architecture

Under the hood, Autensa's research and ideation engine is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's AutoResearch architecture — the program-guided autonomous research loop.

At the center is a Product Program — a living document, similar to Karpathy's program dot md, that instructs the research and ideation agents. It defines what to look for, what matters, and what to ignore.

Research runs inform the next cycle. The program evolves as swipe data accumulates. Agents get sharper with every iteration — not just pattern-matching, but learning your taste.

The agents don't wait for instructions. They follow the program, execute research passes, generate ideas, and loop — exactly like AutoResearch runs experiments autonomously.

And you steer the program, not every individual action. Your swipe decisions become training signal. The system calibrates to what you approve. Karpathy's insight, applied to product development.

---

## Slide 14 — Who This Is For

Autensa is built for builders.

If you're a solo developer who can't research and build and ship at the same time — Autensa handles the research and ideation loop. You swipe, agents build, and your side project improves while you sleep.

If you're a startup founder who needs to iterate faster than competitors — ship improvements daily instead of monthly. Autensa surfaces what competitors are doing and builds your response automatically.

If you're an agency or freelancer managing ten client sites — add each one as a product. Autensa researches and suggests improvements for all of them in parallel.

And if you're an enterprise team with a backlog four hundred tickets deep — Autensa doesn't replace your backlog. It attacks it. Prioritized, researched, and built by agents while your team focuses on what matters most.

---

## Slide 15 — The Numbers

Here's what continuous improvement actually looks like.

Ideas researched per week: manually, you might get through two or three. With Autensa, fifty to a hundred plus.

Features shipped per month: manually, one or two if you're lucky. With Autensa, ten to thirty or more.

Time from idea to pull request: manually, weeks to months. With Autensa, minutes to hours.

---

## Slide 16 — Open Source

Autensa is open source, built for the OpenClaw ecosystem.

It runs on your machine. It uses your API keys. It connects to your repos. No vendor lock-in. No data leaves your setup.

The agents are pluggable — use Claude Code, Codex, or any OpenClaw-compatible agent. Configure them per product.

And it works with any stack. Next.js, React, Python, Rails — if it has a repo, Autensa can improve it.

---

## Slide 17 — Closing

Stop managing a backlog. Start shipping on autopilot.

Autensa v2 is available now for OpenClaw users. Check it out at github dot com slash openclaw slash autensa.
